Both numpy and pandas can load .csv files into memory.
What functions do you need to load csv files?
---
Tip: loading data can often be very challenging, especially if you don't know
what is inside! Luckily, with .csv files, we can open them in other apps to
take a good look.

Tip2: if you want to truly experience what it is like being a data scientist or
software developer, you will feel comfortable googling every answer! There is
a website called stackoverflow.com that is a developers best friend.

Hint: google it :) "python open csv with pandas", you will find many worked
examples. If what you are asking is specific, look out for stackoverflow.com.
