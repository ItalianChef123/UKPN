Let's take another look at github.

Now that you have a new account, it's time to make your first repository!

A repository is like a folder on your laptop, except it is stored online.
When you become more advanced with git, you can syncrhonise the two. For now,
using the website (and one day the desktop app), you can manually upload files.

Log in to github, and from the home page, there is a green button in the top
right of the webpage that says "New".

Follow the instructions on the "Create a new repository" page
    - give your repo name something like "ukpn-work-experience" and make it
        public, and add a little description about your work experience day.
    - It is always good practise to initialise the repository with a README
        file. This is a little introduction to the repo that anyone can view.
    - You can leave the gitignore and license as None for now.
    - hit 'create repository'!

Congratulations, you've made your (maybe) first github repo!

Select 'Add file' and upload all the files from today!
You are now going to 'commit' these changes. This is like saving your work, but
you can add a little note about what the changes were. Github helps by naming
the commit message for you, you can also add a description. 

Software engineers do this ALL the time. Remember Guido has done this over 630
times this year already!

Once you have done your commit, you should see your file in your repo. Notice
that the information shown about your repo is what you initially wrote in the
description. Lets try change it.

Click on your "README.md" file, then click on the pencil editor icon.
You are now editing this file on github.
The text format is called 'Markdown'. This is a type of programming language
for writing pretty text. It is used a lot by software developers in their
documentation. Lets try out writing in Markdown.

when you put a # before some text, it turns it into a title.
when you put a ## before some text, it turns it into a heading.
when you put a ### before some text, it turns it into a sub-heading.

Try format your readme file like so, making changes as you like:

# Title
## Introduction
Write your introduction here, e.g., This is a tutorial you did whilst on work
experience at UK Power Networks with the Smart Grid Development team.
## About the code
Write a brief description to the code you have uploaded.

There are many tutorials on youtube about how to write in Markdown, it can be
a lot of fun!

Now scroll down and commit your changes.

Go back to your github homepage, you should now see a green dot for today, your
profile is starting to look a little like Guido's!
