Taking a break from the code, let's look at github a little closer.

1) Who invented python?
2) Can you find their github profile?
3) How many contributions have they made in the last year?

Tip: Google is a developers best friend. Always. Never feel guilty googling it.

Tip: Github is an essential skill for developers. Starting your journey with
    git early will really help your career. Git can often be used as a CV for
    coders. It lets anyone see how often, and the style of your code.
    Using git, you can build your own projects, or contribute to other
    projects. You can also see the source code for interesting projects, you
    can even contribute to pandas there!
