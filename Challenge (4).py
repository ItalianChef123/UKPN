Is your email address nice and professional? Most developers have a gmail
account because it integrates well with many popular tools.
Why not try secure olithornton1998/7@gmail.com?
Your hotmail address is actually great, this is more a tip incase you have
friends with silly email addresses (we used to have them too)!

With your address, you should sign up to a few popular developer websites and
try secure your preferred username.
1) Sign up for stackoverflow.com
2) sign up to GitHub.com

Tip: github is a place to store your different projects in 'repositories'. All
major software builds are done in the language 'git'. It is a method of keeping
a version control of all changes to a piece of work. You can imagine that when
hundreds of people are building one software, it becomes difficult to balance
all the changes. Github resolves all of this.
